# personal-portfolio


Task:
To build a web page in which personal projects, resume, and contact information can be displayed. The intended use of the web page is for it to be given to future possible employers as a way to showcase personal projects that have been completed. Links will take the user to the appropriate pages, and jump links were to be used to jump the user down the page to their desired location.

What was done:
- Created a sleek display with clickable images that take the user to the indicated project, hosted in GitHub
- Linked contact information and creator's web sites that they would like to have linked
- Created a layout and color theme that compliment the utility of the page as well as the personality of the creator

Note:
- Not all of the links will take the user to an external site. Since I do not have enough projects completed to fill all of the links, some have to be added later. This includes the large file, where I will add a python project that will be finished soon.
- Pictures that do not have a deployed project attached to them have a link to my git hub site as a placeholder.

Screenshots of the working site are provided here: https://github.com/ottercreektourism/geography-quiz-game/issues/2#issue-1093721657

The deployed site is published here:
